# FuzzLabs

**08/09/2016**: The core of the new mutation engine (under engine-core-new branch) is complete.
Some of the next steps:

 * (re-)implement the drivers. Some of the initial planned ones: stdout (done), stderr (done), cli (next), file, network
 * implement that units can include other units

Please note the current version in the master branch is discontinued from this point and very unlikely it will receive any updates. At the end it will be completely replaced with the new version of the framework.


FuzzLabs is a modular fuzzing framework. For more information please refer to the Wiki.
