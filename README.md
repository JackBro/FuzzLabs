**18/07/2016**: The new mutation engine is almost ready. It is more flexible and very modular. It needs some more testing though. Started refactoring / re-writing the other parts of the code too. The main focus is on better usability and even better flexibility. Basically, I said good bye to Sulley completely. The only similarity is some lines of code here and there in the primitives.

**17/06/2016**: Started implementing a new mutation engine. So far it seems to be pretty cool. Feel free to have a look at the code (engine-core-new branch) to see what to expect.

**11/04/2016**: The project is **not** dead. Things are happening in the background just a bit slowly as priorities have changed.


FuzzLabs is a modular fuzzing framework which uses a modified version of Sulley as it's core fuzzing engine.
